# scalloc

A Fast, Multicore-Scalable, Low-Memory-Overhead Allocator

Scalloc is a new concurrent memory allocator that actively utilizes recently
developed efficient and scalable concurrent data structures. Global concurrent
data structures have long been considered performance and scalability
bottlenecks. Hence, many existing allocators aim at minimizing the use of such.
Scalloc, in contrast, freely uses global data structures for reusing memory and
benefits of the existence of new efficient and scalable ones. In terms of
performance and scalability, scalloc is comparable to the best existing
allocators. In terms of memory consumption, it outperforms the best scalable
allocators. The improvement in memory consumption is enabled by the efficiency
of the global data structures, which let scalloc do more work in less time.
Scalloc also borrows commonly used concepts in memory management like size-class
partitioned memory and private heaps. In addition, scalloc introduces a new idea
of virtual spans for uniform treatment of small and big objects without
increased memory fragmentation.

## Binaries

We do not explicitly provide pre-built binaries. However, binaries for Linux
(x86\_64) are generated by our continues integration builds and can be found on
the [scalloc drone.io downloads
page](https://drone.io/github.com/cksystemsgroup/scalloc/files). Note that since
these binaries get generated on very code change, they may not be very stable.

## Building [![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/cksystemsgroup/scalloc/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/cksystemsgroup/scalloc/latest)

We support building on OS X (>10.6) and Linux-based systems using
[gyp](https://code.google.com/p/gyp/). The build setup can also be accessed on
[drone.io](https://drone.io/github.com/cksystemsgroup/scalloc/admin).

### Setting up a build environment

Checkout the latest release version

    git clone https://github.com/cksystemsgroup/scalloc.git
    cd scalloc

We suggest building from the `release` tag, which should be more stable than the
current HEAD. This step is optional.

    git checkout release

If you don't have a global gyp installation, you can get a local one using

    tools/make_deps.sh
    
Then, generate a build environment

    build/gyp/gyp --depth=. scalloc.gyp

### Build on Linux

    BUILDTYPE=Release make

### Build on OSX

Open `scalloc.xcodeproj` and build it using Xcode, or

    build/gyp/gyp --depth=. scalloc.gyp --build=Release

## Usage

In order to make use of scalloc, just preload it using `LD_PRELOAD`.

    LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libscalloc.so ./foo
